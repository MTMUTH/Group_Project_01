## __Group Project 01__

#To Analyze 2017 Standard League Fantasy Football data with the following arguements below

#The success of any draft is predicated on:

#1) Selection of top 5 players from each of the skill position (QB, WR, RB) will generally outperform the remainder of the field.

#2) There is a significant talent gap from top 5 players from each of the skill position compared to “the field”.

#3) A top 5 running back value is incrementally greater than the aforementioned skill positions.
