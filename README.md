# __Proposal:__ 
## In a "DraftKings" type league, where the the Top five Quarterbacks(QB), Running Backs (RB), and Wide Receivers(RB) change and are picked each week. The Top 5 players of each position, each week, will score more points, on aggregate, versus the the rest of the 'field', per week, and over the period of the entire season. In a standard league that is picked in the beginning of the season, and is unchanged throughout the year, unlike a "DraftKings" league, the same outcome will occur.
